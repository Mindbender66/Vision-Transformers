# Brain Disorder Classification Using Deep Learning Model (Vision Transformer)

## Overview

This project involves developing a brain disorder classification model using the Vision Transformer (ViT) deep learning architecture. The aim is to leverage the capabilities of ViT for improved diagnostic accuracy in classifying various brain disorders.

## Features

- **Vision Transformer Model**: Utilizes the Vision Transformer architecture for image classification.
- **Brain Disorder Classification**: Focus on diagnosing various brain disorders from medical images.
- **Improved Diagnostic Accuracy**: Enhanced model performance through the use of advanced deep learning techniques.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Data Preparation

1. Download the brain disorder image datasets.
2. Place the datasets in the `data` directory.
3. Ensure the data is organized into appropriate subdirectories (e.g., `data/brain_disorders`).
